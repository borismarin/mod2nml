# Parsing nmodl and generating NeuroML

One of the most time consuming and error-prone parts of converting NEURON models to NeuroML is the conversion of nmodl mechanisms (.mod files). We intend to automate this process as much as possible.

Here are some test using BlueBrain's [nmodl parser](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nmodl/tree/master) instead of our previous experiments which relied on a [parser built from scratch](https://github.com/borismarin/pynmodl).
